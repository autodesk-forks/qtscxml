    \brief Provides a final state.


    A final state is used to communicate that (part of) a StateMachine has
    finished its work.  When a final top-level state is entered, the state
    machine's \l{State::finished}{finished}() signal is emitted. In
    general, when a final substate (a child of a State) is entered, the parent
    state's \l{State::finished}{finished}() signal is emitted.  FinalState
    is part of \l{Qt State Machine QML Guide}{Qt State Machine QML API}

    To use a final state, you create a FinalState object and add a transition
    to it from another state.
